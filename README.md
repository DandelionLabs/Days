# Days
"Dandelion Days" is the name for a planned circuit of regularly​ recurring public Open Source Software/Open Content events at a series of cities in various countries whose most altruistic educational mentors & Open Source project contributors have agreed to cooperate to realize the outreach mission of our new organization, 'Dandelion Labs'.
The 'Dandelion Labs' outreach mission is described by the motto "Mentorship of Internet Literacy Skills to Inspire Collaboration Cross-pollination of Ideas across Oceans & Open Source Projects".
These Dandelion Days have been inspired by the brilliant implementation of so many innovative massively collaborative project outreach best practices emerging & well-documented at both SageDays events described at the wiki.sagemath.org "How to Host a SageDays" article and Outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Best_practices.
The first dimension of novel cooperation Dandelion Days seeks to inspire is amongst the contributors of these two open source projects which in my investigations appear to be largely unaware of one another's communities of contributors.
The second dimension of cooperation is to inspire new channels of communication​ amongst the populations of geographically & culturally distant cities to encourage the philisophic like-minded beliefs in the power of collaboratively developed open content projects to contribute synergistic benefits to all involved exceeding any other possible utilization of our life's most precious resource, time. We all hope to lead by example the people in each of our disparate locales to understand this rational argument for the promotion of projects encouraging advancement of humanities frontiers & lifting the tide of society's life-boat, unencumbered by considerations for expenses & profit, that can be appreciated even by those who lack the empathy to understand the purpose of altruism, or the wisdom to see the societal needs requiring ongoing reciprocal altruism.
The third dimension of cooperation is between those who develop the features of a project and the mentors & teachers who must inspire others with the same passion for the necessity of keeping these tools supported by healthy communities of participating contributors, to ensure the future defense of developers creations against the decay inevitable as time increases entropy outside of intelligent systems.
There are several more dimensions important to the dynamics of a healthy volunteer technological project community.
For example developers & users, directors & engineers, and more to be discussed in our project philisophy discussion forum.

If I can imagine novel opportunities to create better methods to utilize the good-will & good-fortune of privledged Americans for addressing large scale deficits of opportunity common amongst the less-fortunate by prosyletizing my favorite global collaborations of volunteer contributed effort as time invested for the greatest long-term public good,
then I want to demonstrate these methods to seed the individual franchised outposts of charitable best practices for maximally beneficial altruism measurable for decentralized innovation & intelligence.
Founding this Nonprofit seeks to provide for travel grants for participating in furthering these ideals for all  itof ours supporters.
